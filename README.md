A person uses the internet to access information available globally. While doing so, he uses
many cloud services, with or without his knowledge, while using various websites. A person
may be looking for precise and summarized data, rather than huge documents of information.
Due to an exponential growth in the generation of textual data, the need for tools and
mechanisms for automatic summarization of documents has become very critical. Text
documents are vital to any organization's day-to-day working and as such, long documents often
hamper trivial work. Most of the text resources such as books, news articles, blog posts, research
papers, emails, and tweets present on the internet have repetitive content which is vestigial to the
day-to-day user. Tremendous amounts of information is available on the internet, it is important
to develop a mechanism to extract concise and meaningful summary of text from multiple text
resources quickly and most efficiently from document files and websites. Therefore, an
automatic cloud based text summarizer is vital towards reducing human effort. A cloud based
summarizer helps to provide a user flexibility and portability due to the ability of being able to
use it anywhere, anytime.
